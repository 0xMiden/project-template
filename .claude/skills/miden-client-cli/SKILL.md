description: Map to the official Miden client CLI. The recommended path is via midenup, which installs a managed `client` toolchain component and is invoked as `miden client ...` (component invocation through the midenup `miden` wrapper). The underlying / direct-install path is the `miden-client-cli` crate (`cargo install miden-client-cli --locked`), which exposes the binary `miden-client` and is invoked as `miden-client ...`. Both paths run the same upstream binary. Covers install, init, network selection, and where to find the canonical command reference and configuration docs. Use when an agent needs to create accounts, query state, mint, send, or consume notes against a running Miden node from the command line; pair with the local-node-validation skill for localhost workflows.

# Miden Client CLI

The Miden client CLI is the command-line wrapper around the `miden-client` library. It creates accounts, syncs state, mints assets, sends transactions, and consumes notes against a running Miden node.

This skill maps agents to the canonical install paths and upstream command reference. Do not memorize commands or config keys here. Follow the links.

When to reach for this skill: the user wants to interact with a node from the shell. For Rust-library work against a localhost node from a binary, see the `local-node-validation` skill. For test-side note construction, see `rust-sdk-testing-patterns`.

## Two Invocation Paths

There are two ways to invoke the same upstream binary.

**Through midenup (recommended).** Run `miden client <args>`. This is component invocation: the midenup `miden` wrapper looks up the `client` component in the active toolchain and runs its installed executable. `miden client` is **not** an alias; the midenup README alias table only documents short-hand aliases (such as `miden account`, `miden faucet`, `miden new-wallet`, `miden send`), and component invocation is independent of the alias map. The toolchain manifest declares `installed_executable: miden-client` for the `client` component.

**Direct install.** Run `cargo install miden-client-cli --locked`, then invoke `miden-client <args>`. This installs the same upstream binary that midenup delegates to.

Both paths execute identically.

- miden-client CLI install and setup: [miden-client `bin/miden-cli/README.md`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/blob/main/bin/miden-cli/README.md).

## Install via midenup

```sh
cargo install midenup && midenup init
midenup install stable
```

`midenup init` creates a `miden` symlink in `$CARGO_HOME/bin` (default `~/.cargo/bin`). If `miden` is not found after init, ensure `$CARGO_HOME/bin` is on your `PATH`.

## First-Time Initialization

`init` writes a `miden-client.toml` config in the current directory:

```sh
miden client init --network localhost     # or testnet | devnet | http://<custom-rpc>[:port]
```

Subsequent commands operate against that config. For localhost workflows, pair this skill with `local-node-validation`: it boots a local node on `http://0.0.0.0:57291` and prepares a clean keystore.

## Canonical Command Reference

For the full command list, follow the canonical references:

- CLI Reference: [0xMiden.github.io/miden-docs/miden-client/cli-reference.html](https://0xMiden.github.io/miden-docs/miden-client/cli-reference.html)
- Configuration: [0xMiden.github.io/miden-docs/miden-client/cli-config.html](https://0xMiden.github.io/miden-docs/miden-client/cli-config.html)
- Online docs index: [0xMiden.github.io/miden-docs/miden-client/](https://0xMiden.github.io/miden-docs/miden-client/index.html)

Representative commands (full syntax in the canonical reference):

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `miden client init --network <network>` | Write a `miden-client.toml` config. |
| `miden client sync` | Sync local store with the node. |
| `miden client new-wallet` | Create a wallet account. |
| `miden client new-account --account-type fungible-faucet --packages <path>.masp` | Create an account from a compiled package. |
| `miden client account --list` | List tracked accounts. |
| `miden client mint --target <ID> --asset <AMOUNT>::<FAUCET_ID> --note-type <TYPE>` | Mint assets via a faucet. |
| `miden client send` | Send to another account. |
| `miden client consume-notes --account <ACCOUNT_ID> [NOTE_IDS...]` | Consume notes (omit IDs to consume any consumable note). |

Replace `miden client` with `miden-client` when using the direct-install path.
